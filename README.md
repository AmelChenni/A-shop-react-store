# 🛒 A-Shop: Online E-Commerce Store

🌐 **Live Demo:** [https://a-shop-onlinestore.netlify.app/](https://a-shop-onlinestore.netlify.app/)

---

## 📖 Description

**A-Shop** is a fully interactive e-commerce web application built with React. Users can browse products, filter by category, view product details, search for products, and manage their shopping cart seamlessly.

This project demonstrates practical usage of **React, Context API, React Query, Formik & Yup, JWT decoding, and Local Storage**, simulating a real online store using a **dummy API**.

### About This Project

The project focuses on front-end e-commerce functionality:

- Fetches all products, categories, and product details from a **dummy API**.
- Implements **Login functionality** with pre-defined dummy credentials (`emilys / emilyspass`) and JWT decoding to extract user information.
- Shopping cart fully managed in **Local Storage** (add, delete, update, and calculate totals).
- Uses **Context API** and **React Query** for state and data management.
- Form validation handled by **Formik & Yup** for both login and registration pages (registration page UI only, not functional due to API limitations).
- **Product search functionality** to quickly find items by name or category.
